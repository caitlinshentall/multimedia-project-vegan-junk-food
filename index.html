<p>
A chip shop on the outskirts of Sheffield is hardly the place most people would expect to find hordes of vegans. But <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ranmoorfriery/">Ranmoor Friery</a>, run by 31-year-old Aaron Sandhu, has vegans flocking from miles around to try its products.
</p>


<p>
The chippy was taken over by the Sandhu family in 2016, and started selling it’s first vegan ‘selection box’ in August of that year. With a bit of help from social media, the products started to take off from April 2017.
</p>
<p>
Now, the shop offers plant-based versions of almost anything a vegan could long for. Pea fritters, prawns, fish fingers, battered sausage and chicken nuggets are all available completely animal product-free. And they’ve just introduced vegan gravy and a battered burger to the menu too.
</p>
<p>
Ranmoor Friery is one amongst many eateries which are starting to provide inventive and exciting vegan products which customers can indulge in. Whilst veganism may still be shaking off its health food reputation, those who have become wise to the increasing demand for vegan junk food are cashing in.
</p>
<p>
For many local businesses, though, the priority is providing people with food they can truly enjoy.
</p>
<p>
Ronnie, Aaron’s Mum who has been leading the drive for more vegan options at the chippy, wanted to make sure everyone could be catered for.
</p>
<p>
Ronnie believes vegans should have more options: “people think vegans can only have chips and peas. I don’t think so. I wanted this chip shop to stand out from every other chip shop there is. We want to be different and we want to cater to everybody.”
</p>
<p>
And their vegan options aren’t just tokenistic. Customers love the taste of their products and Ronnie herself can’t resist making herself some of the food sometimes.
</p>
<p>
Many non-vegans are in love with the products too, “The pea fritters are the reason why my waist line is expanding! I used to have one every day, every single day!” exclaims Ronnie.
</p>
<p>
She’s been surprised at who’s jumped on board. “Every Friday I get a phone call and the builders ask for 3 vegan boxes. And they’re not even vegan. It’s lovely to be able to show people that you don’t have to be vegan to have these products.”
</p>
<h3>
Instagram friendly food </h3>

<p>
On the other side of Sheffield is a small café named <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiH0rbS29fYAhXmD8AKHe44BsoQFggxMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fburgerlolz%2F&usg=AOvVaw1GHup1AbfHVUfSWPopvFmI">‘Burgerlolz’</a> . Sheffield’s first ever fully-vegan restaurant, Burgerlolz has grown exponentially since it opened in summer 2016.
</p>
<p>
Burgerlolz’s menu mainly consists of ‘stacked’ burgers, ‘freakshakes’ and southern fried ‘chicken’. These products are nothing like the lentil and tofu-heavy dishes most vegans would have been stuck with in the past. They’re salty, deep fried and there’s hardly a vegetable in sight.
</p>
<p>
And with most young people snapping and sharing their meals these days, they couldn’t have picked more instagrammable food.
</p>
<blockquote>
“It’s become a whole different cuisine of food”
</blockquote>
<p>
“The freakshakes have been really popular because they’re so social media friendly. They look really good on Instagram, especially with the wall’s colours.”
</p>

<p>
Maisie Manterfield, 22, who runs Burgerlolz along with Shaun Whelen, 31, found non-vegan versions of freakshakes and stacked burgers on social media herself and decided to try and veganise them. “This is where a lot of our stuff comes from, I really want to try something but I can’t have it because it’s got meat, eggs or dairy in it. So we go, why don’t we make it vegan?”
</p>
<p>
  “A lot of things happen by accident. You try and veganise one thing and you end up realising it actually tastes like something completely different,” Explains Maisie.
</p>
<p>
And on top of the visuals, the taste of the food is phenomenal. Their seitan-based burgers and soya based freakshakes might not be dead ringers for their meaty equivalents, but they don’t need to be. “It’s become a whole different cuisine of food,” says Maisie, who develops almost all the recipes herself.

<p>
Maisie started doing vegan burgers because they were easy, but she soon discovered that good-quality meat and dairy replacement meals are in great demand. She started out doing pop ups in whatever space she could find, using a George Forman grill, but when a place popped up she got the money together and opened it up a few months later.
</p>
<p>
“We felt really lucky with our timing. This year’s really taken off for us,” she explains. Over the last summer, the couple hardly slept because of how busy the café was. Everything kept running out.
</p>
<p>
“We’re not a massive place at all, but we had no idea it would take off to this level. We thought it would be a couple of years before we were ever booked out. But now, most evenings, we are booked out,” Maisie explains.
</p>
<p>
Their small building, which only seats 18 people, is starting to become a little too small. The couple have plans to branch out whenever they get the chance.
</p>
<h3>
Mainstream veganism
</h3>
<p>
Sheffield is far from unique in its range of vegan offerings. Vegan junk food options have become easy to find most cities and depressing vegetable burgers are a thing of the past.
</p>
<p>
London has a fully vegan fried chicken shop called <a href="http://templeofseitan.co.uk/">Temple of Seitan</a> , in Glasgow you can find Stereo, which offers a <a href="https://www.stereocafebar.com/menu">fully vegan haggis pizza</a>, and Manchester has its own vegan diner called <a href=" http://vrevmcr.co.uk/">VREVS</a>.
</p>
<p>
For Dominic Moss, 31, who manages VREVS, he feels part of a revolution in the UK towards veganism. “Us and other restaurants in the UK are challenging what veganism is. It’s not just lentils and people wearing sandals and hemp sweaters and stuff. There’s nothing wrong with any of that, but there’s a much bigger picture of what veganism can mean.”
</p>
<p>
Starting with a small punk record store in Manchester’s northern quarter, Dom started serving vegan food occasionally. Over time, demand grew for the vegan food and eventually the record store element of the shop faded away.
</p>
<p>
Now the VREVS team have recently moved to a bigger premises and they’re seeing new faces every day. This has meant they can hand-make their burgers and put more love into the food, which, he says, “is what you need right now, with it becoming more and more mainstream”
</p>
<p>
Similar to Burgerlolz, VREVS adds a vegan twist to burgers, hot dogs, poutine and more. And the focus is getting the products to taste amazing. “We’re trying to push what veganism is in people’s minds.”
</p>
<p>
Dom believes the growth of vegan restaurants is down to the change in perceptions of what being vegan means. “I didn’t go vegan because of my health, and I didn’t go vegan because I didn’t like the taste of meat and burgers, I went vegan for environmental and animal rights issues.”
</p>
<p>
And, with Tesco having just released <a href="https://m.thegrocer.co.uk/561850.article?mobilesite=enabled"> its own range</a> of vegan convenience products and <a href=" http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/28-of-brits-have-cut-back-their-meat-consumption-over-the-last-six-months"> 28% of us</a> actively reducing our meat intake, vegan junk food is only going to become bigger and more accessible. With increasing numbers of us having our (vegan) cake and eating it too, there’s little reason not to give it a go.</p>
